# FuelScript-FreeVersion
This is the free version of my advanced fuel script. I have a paid version of this script that is way more advanced on my store page. This script will not be updated as much as the paid script will. The same goes for support. More support will be given on the paid script rather than the free version. If you do need help installing the script, feel free to join my discord:
